        <div class="message">My name is Trenton Bergdahl, and I am a Software Engineering student at Washington State University! I discovered Software Engineering while taking a CPTS course as a requirement of Electrical Engineering, and instantly fell in love with programming. To this day, I do not regret the choice to switch out of EE into SWE. SWE allows for me to problem-solve every day and has become a passion of mine. Some of my hobbies include golfing, wakeboarding, and reading. I am excellent in team projects and have been the team leader on many of the group projects I have participated in here at WSU. I am looking for an internship that will help me gain valuable experience in the industry and help further develop my problem-solving and soft skills.</div>
