        <div class="message">My name is Trenton Bergdahl. I am a Software Engineering student at Washington State University. I discovered Software Engineering while taking a computer science course as a requirement of Electrical Engineering, and instantly fell in love with programming. To this day, I am still happy that I made the choice to switch out of electrical engineering into software engineering.</div>

        <div class ="message-right"> Software engineering has become a passion of mine because it allows me to problem solve every day. One of my favorite things in programming is coming up with a creative solution to an issue that utilizes data structures or pointers in ways that I've never seen before. I love seeing examples of other people's work that have extensive experience and stepping through their code line by line to understand it. Some of my hobbies include golfing, wakeboarding, and reading. I am excellent in team projects and have been the team leader on many of the group projects I have participated in here at WSU. </div>

        <div class ="message">One of my most valuable traits is that I learn new ideas and procedures quickly. This makes me very adaptive and allows me to have a diverse knowledge of many different applications of software development. I have a direct communication style and I am told I do well in any role I am put in. I am looking for an internship that will push me to the next level by applying the basics that I've learned to real-world problems, further expanding my problem solving abilities. I also hope to gain experience in a professional work environment.</div>
